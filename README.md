Final Project — Responsive Portfolio Site
This project is a personal portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my web development projects and skills. It includes a homepage, portfolio gallery, contact form, and custom styling, reflecting the design and coding techniques I’ve learned at Saint Paul College.
